## Introduction

The Code of Professional Conduct (COPC) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of COPC is to facilitate an inclusive and diverse _community_ of professionals who productively work toward shared professional goals.

In service of this purpose, we open the _community_ to all _qualified individuals_ and we require that all _members_ refrain from _unprofessional conduct_. Except as otherwise noted, we do not impose any ideology onto _members_, nor do we restrict participation based on people's _personal attributes_ or their _conduct_ in other communities.

## Community Conduct

We strongly encourage _members_ to assume the best in every _interaction_; to be open, honest, and empathic in all _communication_; and to demonstrate politeness and professional courtesy in every situation.

We welcome any closed group of _members_ to engage in any _conduct_ for which there is explicit and unanimous mutual consent. In the absence of such consent, we impose the following restrictions on _conduct_, which are further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Harass**. Only _interact_ with people who consent to the _interaction_.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not attempt to ascertain the private content or _communication_ of others.
* **Don't Insult**. Do not _insult_ others or aspects of who they are.

These requirements on _conduct_ apply to _members_ only while they are _actively participating_ in the _community_. Except as otherwise noted, the standing of _members_ is unaffected by _conduct_ that does not comply with these requirements if this _conduct_ occurs in other communities.

## Universal Conduct

We impose the following restrictions on _conduct_, which are further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Dox**. Do not publish details of _members_ that you learn about while _actively participating_.
* **Don't Retaliate**. Do not _retaliate_ against _members_ for the resolution or reporting of an _incident_.

These requirements on _conduct_ apply to _members_ at all times, even when they are not _actively participating_ in the _community_.

## Reporting

**Unofficial Resolution**. For unofficial resolution, we encourage _aggrieved members_ to speak to _accused members_ directly, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC). At the request of an _aggrieved member_, we will appoint a mediator who can facilitate an unofficial resolution and serve as a witness for subsequent reporting.

**Official Resolution**. For official resolution, _aggrieved members_ must report the _incident_ to us and request an official resolution. We will appoint an _arbiter_, who will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action. The course of action will involve rejecting the _incident_, or accepting it as a _violation_ and imposing a consequence on the _violator_.

**Consequences**. _Violators_ may be asked to apologize or to undergo training, counseling, or mediation as a condition of continued participation. They may also be banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the _arbiter_. In no case will the consequence exceed banishment, unless the violation is also governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws. We reserve the right to re-evaluate a previously imposed _consequence_.

**Social Rehabilitation**. We will only banish individuals for a pre-determined time, not to exceed 5 years. We reserve the right to reintegrate banned individuals into the _community_ through our own rehabilitation process.

**Confidentiality**. We reserve the right to publicly share information about any _violation_ that results in banishment, including personally identifiable information on the _violator_, limited to name and online identities. In all other cases, we will keep _incidents_ and the identities of _aggrieved_ and _accused_ confidential to the extent this confidentiality is fully respected by all parties.

**Reporting Requirements**. Incidents that happen while _actively participating_ must be reported to us within 15 days by _aggrieved members_ (we will investigate third-party reports at our sole discretion). Incidents involving _doxxing_ or _retaliation_ must be reported to us within 5 years of their occurrence. Information that any individual believes may affect our view of the _qualifications_ of an individual may be reported at any time.

## Our Pledges

**Enforcement**. We pledge that we will make reasonable efforts to enforce the terms and conditions set forth in COPC, and to hold ourselves to these same standards, thereby setting a positive example for others to follow.

**Contact Information**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to provide contact information for use in reporting _incidents_, including an estimate of how quickly _members_ can expect to receive a response.

**Community Boundaries**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to provide information on the boundaries of the _community_, including information on any regions in time or space that are partially or fully exempt from COPC.

**Non-Coercion**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to never coerce _members_ into revealing private information, making statements, or otherwise requiring actions that are unnecessary for the scope of participating in a given _community_ activity.

**Disclosure**. Upon request from an _unqualified individual_, we pledge to make reasonable efforts to provide a written, anonymized summary to the individual that discloses the rationale and evidence resulting in their status, and we grant them permission to share this disclosure privately or publicly, providing they do so in its entirety.

**Unbiased Arbitration**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to appoint balanced or neutral _arbiters_ for every arbitration, without special relationships to _aggrieved_ or _accused_, or vested interest in any specific outcome. In the event that unbiased arbitration is impossible or too onerous, we pledge to disclose all known biases.

**Merit Transparency**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to continuously communicate whether the status, authority, or responsibility of individual _members_ is awarded or withheld based on _personal attributes_ that are not relevant to their function in the _community_.

**Amendments**. Any part of COPC, including but not limited to definitions in the glossary, may be unilaterally amended by us. We pledge to clearly specify and distribute such amendments together with COPC.

## Disclaimers

**Disputes of Interpretation**. In the event there is a dispute about the meaning of any term or clause in COPC, we alone will clarify the intent, independent of how other COPC communities have clarified the meaning. We pledge to be consistent in our interpretation of any ambiguity.

**Criminal Conduct**. COPC is not intended to supplant the laws of governing jurisdictions, but to impose a set of terms and conditions on community membership for law-abiding individuals. _Criminal conduct_ of any kind should be immediately reported to relevant authorities and dealt with as recommended by such authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if _criminal conduct_ also violates COPC, we reserve the right to deal with such conduct as described herein.

**Non-Endorsement**. In recognition of the pluralistic composition of the _community_, the _community_ does not endorse the attitudes, beliefs, moral systems, personality traits, political views, preferences, religions, or values of ourselves or of any _member_ of the _community_. No _member_ ever speaks for or represents the _community_, and neither do we speak for or represent the _community_ unless we are acting in our official capacities, and then only for the scope of the task at hand.

**Limitation of Remedy**. Unless otherwise stated, COPC is not intended as a legally binding agreement. In the event we fail to uphold any of our pledges as made herein, remedy is limited to a formal public apology and reversal of any consequences (if applicable), unless the breach is governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws.

 * **Community Qualification Criteria**. We define _community qualification criteria_ to be published and publicly accessible criteria that are useful and objectively relevant to the professional goals of the _community_. This criteria may include objectively verifiable criteria (such as capability to perform a task), or unverifiable criteria. The satisfaction of all unverifiable criteria, including requirements on the attitudes, beliefs, moral systems, personality traits, political views, preferences, religions, and values of an individual, must be determined solely by the individual's own confessions, and may not be determined by third-party statements, except insofar as they are witnesses for the individual's own confessions.

We define _community sabotage_ to be any _conduct_ that does have or is intended to have the effect of harming the professional goals of the _community_, including but not limited to attempting to defund or blackball the _community_, attempting to disrupt or diminish the activities of the _community_, and authoring, spreading, or endorsing libel or slander about the _community_; or encouraging others to engage in the preceding _conduct_. Explicitly excluded from this definition is _communication_ of truthful information regarding the _community_ and truthful criticism on the failure of the _community_ to achieve its professional goals.
* **Conduct**. We define _conduct_ to include all and only observable actions of people, and to explicitly exclude all _personal attributes_.
 * **Criminal Conduct**. We define _criminal conduct_ to be any _conduct_ that is illegal under the laws of the governing jurisdiction. Explicitly excluded from _criminal conduct_ is any illegal _conduct_ in which those directly and immediately impacted by the _conduct_ are legally adults and do not consider themselves to be victims (including recreational use of drugs, consensual prostitution, failure of adults to wear seat belts, and the like).
 * **Destructive Individual**. We define _destructive individual_ to be any individual that we intentionally label destructive, and for whom one or more of the following hold:
    * We believe the individual is likely to engage in _criminal conduct_, and we or other individuals have contacted authorities to report the _conduct_ that motivated this belief.
    * We believe the individual is likely to engage in _community sabotage_, and the individual has participated in previous _community sabotage_ or there is credible evidence suggesting the individual is planning to engage in future _community sabotage_.

 * **Prying**. We define _prying_ to be any _unauthorized_ attempt (whether legal or illegal) to ascertain the _communication_ of semi-private forms of communication (including phone calls, direct messages, texts, private conversations), or to ascertain content on private devices or private channels of communication belonging to other _members_, where _unauthorized_ means the individual _prying_ does not have explicit permission from the owner of said device or by the authors of said communication.

 * **Violation**. We define _violation_ to be any actual infringement of COPC as determined by an _arbiter_.
 * **Violator**. We define _violator_ to be any _accused member_ who has broken the terms and conditions of COPC, as determined by an _arbiter_.
